# Captains Courageous

This is a website I created for a one day festival held in Gloucester back in 2012. 

The site relies on a database to pull data about festival events that are happening throughout the day.

The site itself of course is HTML and CSS. I used JavaScritpt and JQuery on the client side and used PHP to query the MYSQL database. The database is relational, consisting of 6 different tables. The SQL queries comprised a few inner joins to pull all the information
