Solomon Jacobs Crossed Wakes in Wartime Gloucester.  Chester Brigham\'s latest book of Gloucester history and art, On Opposite Tacks, compares and contrasts the careers of two men who epitomized the diametrically opposite populations that have long defined this crusty, colorful New England seaport: fishermen and artists.</p>\r\n<p>John Sloan, major American painter identified with the \"Ashcan School,\" and Capt. Solomon Jacobs, schooner fisherman and ocean adventurer, were both in Gloucester from 1914 to 1918. Sloan, during five consecutive extended summers in Gloucester, was reinventing himself as an artist following the upheaval in the arts occasioned by the 1913 Armory Show in New York. Paintings of Sloan\'s \"Gloucester period\" are looser than his earlier works, more spontaneous, with exuberant colors.*</p>\r\n<p>Capt. Jacobs was winding down a colorful career of voyaging and enterprise, but was not yet ready to go quietly. Then America entered World War I, and the Gloucester fishing fleet was decimated by U-boat attacks. Capt. Jacobs, aged 70, volunteered and served as an Ensign in the U.S. Navy Volunteer Reserve. John Sloan, a pacifist, opposed the war. On Opposite Tacks explores the contrasts and parallels between the two men that shaped their differing responses to life and war.</p>','http://www.downthefort.com',''),(2,'Author, John Morris','','http://www.aloneatsea.com/john-n-morris',''),(29,'Maritime Gloucester ','<p>will be hosting author book talks in the Gorton\'s Gallery and have the Gorton\'s Gallery open for free visits&nbsp;(Touch Tanks and aquarium require&nbsp; admission ticket)</p>','www.gloucestermaritimecenter.org/',''),(30,'Sargent Murray House','<p>will offer house tours and readings from the Judith Sargent Stevens</p>','http://sargenthouse.org/',''),(31,'Cape Ann Cinema ','Cape Ann Cinema is so happy to be part of the lives of Cape Ann’ers, not just as a provider of great films and a fantastic atmosphere in which to enjoy them, but also as a place to make memories on a grander scale.
